# CS420 - Final Project

Final project topics will be chosen by the student and must be approved by no later than April 7. Examples of potential
final project topics will be given throughout the semester. The requirements for each of the final projects include:

Final project report: Minimum 6 page 2 column IEEE conference format report Poster and poster presentation Final
projects will typically include the implementation of a biologically-inspired computing algorithm, so the associated
code will also be submitted. Poster presentations will take place on May 3, May 5, and May 10. Students will be assigned
the day on which they will present, though if you have a preference for May 3 or May 5, I will do my best to accommodate
that request. Final reports will be due on May 11.
